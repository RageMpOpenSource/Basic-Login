#Basic-Login (Client-Side)
This contains the client-side class structure and the modules that are required to display the .html file that one would create.
It will also show an example of how to execute ExecuteJS() within a RAGE.Ui.HtmlWindow and how to process information within the html page
instead of continuously sending the information back and forth to the client and CEF before passing it to the Server-Side.
